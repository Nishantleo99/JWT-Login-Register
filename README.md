# JWT-Login-Register
A project that uses JWT(Json Web Tokens) for authenticating a user (tested in Postman), a login and register page where a user can register
or login themselves and see their data in the form of a table.

Files that I have created/edited:

#Front-end:
1. client -> src -> App.js
Under client -> src -> components ->
2. Landing.js
3. Login.js
4. Navbar.js
5. Profile.js
6. Register.js
7. UserFunctions.js

#Back-end:
1. server.js
2. models -> User.js
3. routes -> Users.js

All the data is also being stored in MongoDB(local) for reference.

For running this project, type "npm run both" without quotation marks in the terminal.
